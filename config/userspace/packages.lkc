    bool "autoconf"
    help
       GNU's Autoconf is a tool for configuring source code and Makefiles.
       Using Autoconf, programmers can create portable and configurable
       packages, since the person building the package is allowed to specify
       various configuration options.

       You should install Autoconf if you are developing software and you
       would like to use it to create shell scripts that will configure your
       source code packages. If you are installing Autoconf, you will also
       need to install the GNU m4 package.

       Note that the Autoconf package is not required for the end-user who
       may be configuring software with an Autoconf-generated script;
       Autoconf is only required for the generation of the scripts, not their
       use.

       You should install Automake if you are developing software and would
       like to use its ability to automatically generate GNU standard
       Makefiles. If you install Automake, you will also need to install
       GNU's Autoconf package.

       Bison is a general purpose parser generator that converts a grammar
       description for an LALR(1) context-free grammar into a C program to
       parse that grammar. Bison can be used to develop a wide range of
       language parsers, from ones used in simple desk calculators to complex
       programming languages. Bison is upwardly compatible with Yacc, so any
       correctly written Yacc grammar should work with Bison without any
       changes. If you know Yacc, you should not have any trouble using
       Bison. You do need to be proficient in C programming to be able
       to use Bison. Bison is only needed on systems that are used for
       development.

       If your system will be used for C development, you should install
       Bison.

      Boa is a single-tasking HTTP server. That means that unlike
      traditional web servers, it does not fork for each incoming connection,
      nor does it fork many copies of itself to handle multiple connections.
      It internally multiplexes all of the ongoing HTTP connections, and
      forks only for CGI programs (which must be separate processes),
      automatic directory generation, and automatic file gunzipping.
      The primary design goals of Boa are speed and security. Security,
      in the sense of "can't be subverted by a malicious user," not "fine
      grained access control and encrypted communications". Boa is not
      intended as a feature-packed server.

        tool conntrack provides a full featured interface that is
        intended to replace the old /proc/net/ip_conntrack interface.
        Using conntrack, you can view and manage the in-kernel
        connection tracking state table from userspace. On the
        other hand, conntrackd covers the specific aspects of
        stateful firewalls to enable highly available scenarios,
        and can be used as statistics collector as well

        conntrack-tools requires libnetfilter_conntrack,
        libnfnetlink and a kernel that features the
        netnetlink_conntrack subsystem. For officially
        released kernels, this means 2.6.14, but we suggest you
        to use 2.6.18 or later

      IrDA(TM) (Infrared Data Association) is an industry standard for
      wireless, infrared communication between devices. IrDA speeds range
      from 9600 bps to 4 Mbps, and IrDA can be used by many modern devices
      including laptops, LAN adapters, PDAs, printers, and mobile phones.

      The Linux-IrDA project is a GPL'd implementation, written from
      scratch, of the IrDA protocols. Supported IrDA protocols include
      IrLAP, IrLMP, IrIAP, IrTTP, IrLPT, IrLAN, IrCOMM and IrOBEX.

      The irda-utils package contains a collection of programs that enable
      the use of IrDA protocols. Most IrDA features are implemented in the
      kernel, so IrDA support must be enabled in the kernel before any IrDA
      tools or programs can be used. Some configuration outside the kernel
      is required, however, and some IrDA features, like IrOBEX, are
      actually implemented outside the kernel.

      Perl is a high-level programming language with roots in C, sed, awk

      and is especially good at handling text.  Perl's hallmarks are
      practicality and efficiency.  While it is used to do a lot of
      different things, Perl's most common applications are system
      administration utilities and web programming.  A large proportion of
      the CGI scripts on the web are written in Perl.  You need the perl
      package installed on your system so that your system can handle Perl
      scripts.

      Install this package if you want to program in Perl or enable your

      set of processes. The snice command is used to change the scheduling
      priority of specified processes. The tload command prints a graph of

      displays the current time, how long the system has been running, how
      many users are logged on, and system load averages for the past one,
      five, and fifteen minutes. The w command displays a list of the users
      who are currently logged on and what they are running. The watch

    create a semantic parse tree for some arbitrary user for further

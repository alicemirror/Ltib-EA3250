Logic PD LH7A404 board deployment instructions
************************************************************************
To boot Linux on the Logic PD LH7A404 board, you will need the Apex
bootloader (apex.bin), the kernel image (zImage), and a root file
system image (rootfs.ext2.gz). The root file system can be mounted via
a ramdisk image, NFS, or from a CF card.

The default LTIB configuration will build the Apex and Linux images and
a root file system suitable for NFS mounting.

Setup procedure
************************************************************************
The Logic PD boards come with a pre-installed bootloader (lolo) that is
used to boot and load Apex. For this deployment, the following setup
is used:
 * lolo is configured to boot Apex over the network using TFTP
 * Apex is configured from the Apex build menu with the required Linux
   download and boot options. This includes the location where to get
   the Linux image file and the command line passed to the Linux kernel.
 * Apex loads and kicks off Linux kernel
 * Linux kernel mounts root file system over NFS

On your LPD7A404 board, connect a serial cable between a PC and the
board and start a terminal program at 115.2K-8N1 on the PC. Connect an
ethernet cable between the board and an ethernet switch. The board
should be able to access the Linux system that is being used to build
the LPD7A404 embedded Linux system (LTIB).

Downloading the bootloader (apex.bin) to the LPD7A404 board
************************************************************************
Lolo can be configured to automatically run several commands when it
is started. The commands to load and start Apex over the network are
shown below. Lolo can also be setup to load and execute Apex over NOR
FLASH or from a CF card. See the Lolo documentation for more information
on how to set up alternate boot methods.

Basic lolo commands for loading and starting Apex over the network:
ifconfig sm0 192.168.1.55
load raw 0xc0200000 0x00020000 /tftp/192.168.1.51:apex.bin
exec 0xc0200000

Note: Be sure to setup network addresses that are suitable for your
network environment.

These commands can be automated with the following lolo instruction. Be
sure to type is carefully and exactly as shown (with your setup's IP
addresses) or lolo may not work correctly. The entire string should be
typed on one line. If the command fails, lolo should eventually timeout.

echo "LOLOifconfig sm0 192.168.1.55; load raw 0xc0200000 0x00020000 /tftp/192.168.1.51:apex.bin; exec 0xc0200000; exit;" /dev/serial_eeprom

If everything is correct, you should be able to reset the board and
see the Apex boot loader after a few seconds.

Setting up Apex to boot the kernel over the network
************************************************************************
Apex can be setup to boot the Linux image over the network using TFTP
by changing the Apex environment variables in the Apex menu. 

The 2 important environment variables to change are the startup command
and the boot command line to the kernel.

The startup command specifies what Apex does when it is started and can
b selected in the Apex environment menu. The command listed below will
load and execute the Linux kernel from a TFTP server on IP address
192.168.1.51 and set it's own IP address to 192.168.1.55.

ipconfig 192.168.1.55
cp tftp://192.168.1.51/zImage 0xc0010000
go 0xc0010000

The default startup can be overriden by placing all these commands on
the override startup line in the Apex menu seperated by semicolons.

The Linux kernel command line specifies options such as the serial port
to use for the console or the location of the root file system. It can
be overriden by changing the default in Apex. The following command
line will use the LTUB generated root filesystem image over NFS for
it's file system.

console=ttyAM1,115200n81 rw root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=192.168.1.51:/home/ltib/rootfs ip=dhcp

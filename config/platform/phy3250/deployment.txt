PHY3250 board deployment instructions
***********************************************************************
These are basic instructions on deploying Linux to your PHY3250 board
using TFTP and NFS. These instructions assume you have some experience
with setting up your TFTP and NFS servers.

More detailed instructions and a complete board Linux startup document
can be obtained from Phytec's website.

Your PHY3250 board should have come pre-installed with the S1L boot
loader. S1L handles board initialization and second level application
boot (in this case u-boot).

For steps and information regarding S1L and setup of the board's USB to
UART adapter, see the User's manual for the PHY3250 board included with
the board or available from Phytec's website. You can also get the
bootloader document from the LPC32X0 CDL located on NXP's website.

Initial board setup and starting S1L
************************************************************************
Plus a serial cable between the PHY3250 board's bottom RS232 conenctor
and a PC. Open a terminal program (such as Teraterm) for the COM port
at 115.2K-8-N-1.

Reset the board and the "Phytec LPC3250 board" banner should appear with
a prompt. If the board attempts to boot something, press any ket to stop
the boot and get to the prompt.

If you are planning on loading images over the network, connect an
ethernet cable between the board and a switch.

u-boot installation and setup
************************************************************************
Once you have your u-boot.bin image, you can use the following sequence
to copy u-boot to the board and setup S1L to automatically run it on
powerup or reset.

phy3250>load term raw 0x83fc0000
Starting terminal download, send break to stop

Using the "send binary" capability of the terminal program, send the
u-boot.bin to the board as a binary image. After the file has completely
transferred, send a break sequence via the terminal program to get back
to the phy3250> prompt. (In Teraterm, this can be done with ALT-b).

Type nsave at the prompt to save the image in NAND FLASH.
phy3250>nsave

Set S1L to boot the image on powerup.
phy3250>aboot flash raw 0x83fc0000

Finally, set the S1L boot delay to 2 seconds.
phy3250> prompt phy3250> 2

Press reset to reboot the board. After a few seconds, u-boot should
start.

Setting up u-boot to boot the kernel using TFTP using DHCP
************************************************************************
At the u-boot prompt, change the server IP address to your host
machine's IP address and save the new u-boot environment settings. The
following sequence should do it:

setenv serverip 192.168.1.51 (Use your host machine address here)
setenv bootcmd 'dhcp; bootm'
saveenv

Make sure your host machines's TFTP server is setup and that the kernel
image (uImage) is in the TFTP file area. Reset the board and the kernel
should boot.

The board can be setup to boot using static IP by also changing the
bootcmd environment variable to 'tftpboot; bootm' and also setting the
ipaddr and netmask environment variables to the desired values.

Setting up the kernel's root filesystem
************************************************************************
In the previous step, the kernel started but then probably gave a
'kernel panic' error and then appeared to stop. This is most likely
because it couldn't find a root filesystem. The root filesystem can be
located on a network NFS share, an SD card partition, as a compressed
image uncompressed by Linux into memory at run-time, or in the NAND
FLASH. This example only shows how to setup the kernel to mount the
root filesystem using NFS. (See the Phytec Linux manual for more booting
options).

Reset the board and boot to u-boot. Once the u-boot message appears,
press any key to get to the u-boot prompt. Type 'printenv' to dump the
current environment variables and examine the bootargs variable. This
variable is used by the kernel to define the console device (serial
port), location of the root filesystem, init file location, network
setup, etc.

Change the bootargs variable as follows to use NFS for the root
filesystem on your machine. Make sure your NFS server is setup to serve
the files on your host machine from the correct location.

setenv bootargs 'console=ttyS0,115200n81 root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=192.168.1.51:/home/<user>/ltib/rootfs ip=dhcp'
saveenv

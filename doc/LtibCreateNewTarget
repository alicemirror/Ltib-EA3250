---+ How to add a new target platform to LTIB

This is a quick HOWTO that will show how to add a new target platform into LTIB.

For the purposes of this tutorial, an existing mpc8555cds is used as the
template for a new mpc5200 target.

This tutorial assumes that you are working using the latest cvs HEAD for LTIB.


---++ What you should have available before you start

   * A working cross toolchain for your target.  Many are already available in the toolchain foundry and show in existing LTIB targets.

   * Kernel source and a kernel .config file for your target.

   * If required, bootloader source for your target.


---++ Create a placeholder for the new target BSP

To do this copy an existing target for later editing.  This will serve as
a template for the new target.

You should use an existing target that is the closest match for your new
target.

<verbatim>
cd ~/ltib/config/platform
cp -a mpc8555cds mpc5200
rm -rf mpc5200/CVS
</verbatim>


---++ Update the main.lkc file for your platform.

The main things you need to change are:


---+++ Platform information

You need to check and update the following as required:

| *CONFIG_TITLE*     | This is the name that shows up at the top of the LTIB config menu |
| *PLATFORM_COMMENT* | This is similar to CONFIG_TITLE, this shows up in the platform selection menu when you first run LTIB. |
| *VENDOR*           | This should be set to the board's vendor name |
| *PLATFORM*         | This should exactly match the directory name of this platform (e.g. mpc5200) |
| *GNUTARCH*         | This is the GNU architecture name for this target (e.g. powerpc) |
| *LINTARCH*         | This is the Linux architecture name for this target (e.g. ppc) |
| *CFGHOST*          | This is the name that configure should use for the --host entry when running configure for a package (e.g. powerpc-linux) |


Set these to be appropriate for your platform.


---+++ Capabilities section

This can normally be left (empty).  The defaults come from 
config/userspace/defaults.lkc.  The sorts of things that you may need
to change are ERASE_BLOCK_SIZE for instance, if your Flash erase blocks
are not 64KB.


---+++ Toolchain selection

Look at and update the toolchains as appropriate.  There should be at 
least 2 choices:

| *TOOLCHAIN1*       | (something from the toolchain foundry, see: http://twiki.freescale.net/bin/view.cgi/MWERKS/ToolchainFoundry) |
| *TOOLCHAIN_CUSTOM* | this is used to select customer toolchains |

You need to put in corresponding defaults for *TOOLCHAIN1* in the following areas:

| *TOOLCHAIN*        | selects the toolchain's x86 rpm filename. e.g. mtwk-lnx-powerpc-603e-gcc-3.3.2-glibc-2.3.2-0.28-6.i686.rpm |
| *TOOLCHAIN_PATH*   | the install path to the toolchain, minus the /bin. e.g. /opt/mtwk/usr/local/powerpc-603e-linux/gcc-3.3.2-glibc-2.3.2 |
| *TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX* | the cross compiler prefix. e.g. powerpc-603e-linux- |
| *TOOLCHAIN_CFLAGS* | any mandatory CFLAGS that must be used with your chosen cross compiler.  These should be conditioned per toolchain.  e.g. default "xxxx" if TOOLCHAINn |


---+++ Bootloader selection

This is optional, but if you have a bootloader you want built, adjust 
this area appropriately.


---+++ Kernel selection

There should be at least 2 entries:

| *KERNEL1*     | a description of your for the target. e.g. "Linux 2.6.11.7 for MPCLite5200B (from PCS BSP)" |
| *KERNEL_NONE* | this entry is so you can disable kernel building |

You need to put the corresponding defaults for *KERNEL1*:

| *PKG_KERNEL*           | the name of the specfile to build this kernel, without the .spec extension.  e.g. default "kernel-2.6.11-mpclite5200b" if KERNEL1 |
| *PKG_KERNEL_PRECONFIG* | the filename of the kernel config file to be used with your specfile.  This should reside in the directory 'config/platform/<PLATFORM>. e.g. default "linux-2.6.11-mpclite5200b.config" if KERNEL1 |


---++ Add any new spec files

If your main.lkc refers to any new spec files, you need to add them in 
to the directory: dist/lfs-5.1/<package> (e.g. package may be kernel, u-boot etc).


---++ Configure your ltib config file.

Run:
<verbatim>
./ltib --configure
</verbatim>

This will configure your platform based on the settings of the one 
you've copied.  Make adjustments as required.  When you save and exit, a 
'.config' file will be saved in your platform's directory and ltib will 
build this configuration.

When you are done, copy the .config to defconfig in your platform's 
directory e.g:

<verbatim>
cp config/platform/mpc5200/.config config/platform/mpc5200/defconfig
</verbatim>


---++ Saving your work.

Once you have a default config you are happy with and your platform 
builds and boot, you need to commit the new files to LTIB's CVS and copy 
any sources to the GPP.  

To save files to the GPP, use the link 'Upload 
a file to the GPP' http://www.bitshrine.org/cgi-bin/gpp_upload.cgi.

Note: you need to be a project member to do this.  Otherwise, please 
submit your patches to the public mailing list.

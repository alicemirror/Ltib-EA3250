---+ Introduction

Here is a quick note on various techniques and best practices for maintaining
LTIB BSP.


---+ How to upgrade a BSP (i.e. not-maintenance).

---++ Scenario

A BSP exists for a target and some time has gone by.  Now you want to
re-release that BSP, possibly adding new kernels, toolchains bootloaders etc.
What should you do?

---++ Which CVS should I use

After the last release of this BSP, the release team should have merged
back from their branch into the trunk of CVS.  If this has not happened,
you must do this first.  

Now that some time has gone by and you are adding something new not
so much  fixing a bug (even though that may be an indirect consequence)
you should be working to start with on the HEAD of the trunk of CVS.

Once you have added the new stuff and have it basically working, you should
re-branch and follow the release process documented in LtibReleaseProcess


---++ Principles

   1. If we've released something before the selections
   of kernel/bootloader/toolchain should still be available to users
   2. Don't knowingly break older stuff.  
   3. Newer is not always better (to everyone).  Some people really need
   to have the old stuff available to them (even if it's not the default).


---++ What should I do to add a new toolchain and kernel?

---+++ General principles

Lets say you have new toolchain and a new kernel that you want to
upgrade people to.  Here's what to do:

   * __ADD__ the new toolchain as the next one in the selection list.  
   * __LEAVE__ the old toolchain tokens in place

---+++ Example: adding a new toolchain

In the patch below, here's an example showing how I added a new toolchain
to the tqm823l platform:

---+++ Example: adding a new kernel

Here is an example that shows the addition of a new kernel to a target.

First, here's the patch of the main.lkc file.  I've snipped it back
to remove the hunks we're not interested in:

---++ Remember to upload the content to the GPP or send a patch

Before you check-in changes to LTIB CVS that reference new content
(e.g. toolchains, source tarballs and patches), you must uploaded
the to the GPP using this link: http://www.bitshrine.org/cgi-bin/gpp_upload.cgi

In order to use this link you must be a trusted developer with a password.
Until that has been arranged, please send patches to the LTIB public
mailing list

---++ Pre-selecting the new stuff

Having added your changes to main.lkc (leaving the old stuff in place), 
and added any new config files, run:
<verbatim>
./ltib --configure
</verbatim>

Make the changes you need to your overall configuration so that the BSP
works with your updates as you require.  Your configuration points
will now have been captured in:

   * config/platform/&lt;target&gt;/defconfig.dev
   * config/platform/&lt;target&gt;/&lt;linux_config_name&gt;.dev

If you want to make your new overall configuraton the new default, move
the config/platform/&lt;target&gt;/defconfig.dev to 
config/platform/&lt;target&gt;/defconfig and check-in the update.

If you have updated your new Linux configuration file, you should move
this from the '.dev' name to a version without the '.dev'.  Normally
this will be a new file, so you need to 'cvs add' it before checking
it in to cvs.


---++ Why is this important

Imagine you're a poor user using CVS.  Your config is setup and you're
working on (and happy with) a certain toolchain and kernel.  If someone
changes the meaning of TOOLCHAIN1 or KERNEL1, when you do a cvs update,
you'll be subjected to a situation whereby your current configuration is
invalid.  Worse still the old selections you _WANTED_ have disappeared.
How rude....

This situation would likely lead to frustration by users and lots of
extra support traffic.

---++ Conclusion

---+++ Dos

   * Add new stuff
   * Update the defconfig

---+++ Donts

   * Remove old stuff 

---+++ Exceptions

There are always exceptions, but please discuss first on the LTIB list
if you are thinking that your case is an exception.

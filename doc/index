---+ Introduction

The LTIB (Linux Target Image Builder) project is a simple tool that can be used to develop and deploy BSPs (Board Support Packages) for various target platforms. Using this tool a user will be able to develop a GNU/Linux image for their target platform. For more information, see the [[/autodocs/LtibFaq.html][LtibFaq]]

---+ Quick install

---++ You have regular Internet access and want the latest

If you just want to try out LTIB as an end user and have a Linux host
machine, download the following simple installer [[netinstall][netinstall]] and run as
a non-root account:
<verbatim>
$ perl netinstall
</verbatim>

---++ If you only have proxy access or want a fixed snapshot

You not be able to run the netinstall as this checks out the
latest LTIB from CVS.  So instead, download the latest release from here
[[http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/ltib/ltib-8-1-2a-sv.tar.gz][ltib-8-1-2a-sv.tar.gz]] and then:

<verbatim>
$ tar zxvf ltib-8-1-2a-sv.tar.gz
$ cd ltib-8-1-2-sv
</verbatim>

If you only have proxy access to the Internet

   * edit .ltibrc
      * add an entry for %http_proxy (the exact entry depends on your proxy)
      * change %proxy setting from 0 to 1

Finally, whether proxied or not:
<verbatim>
$ ./ltib
</verbatim>

If you need to know more, please read on.

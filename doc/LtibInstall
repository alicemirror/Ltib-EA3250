---+ Installation of LTIB (GNU/Linux Target Image Builder)

---+ Introduction

LTIB is usually distributed in a tarball, which includes this file.

You should unpack this tarball in your home directory, or somewhere
else you have write permissions, this will create the sub-directory
'ltib'


---+ Running LTIB

To run ltib, change into the directory you have unpacked ltib into
and then run ./ltib.  For instance, the sequence could be:

<verbatim>
cd ~
tar zxvf /tmp/ltib-5.1.1.tar.gz
cd ltib
./ltib
</verbatim>

If you have never installed a copy of ltib on your machine before,
a number of host packages will be built and installed that will
help support ltib (currently: texinfo, lkc, wget).  This may take
a few minutes. 

After the host packages have been installed, a 'blue screen' will be
presented (similar to the kernel's menuconfig).  This will let
you choose which platform you wish to install a target image for.

Once you have chosen your target platform, exit and save.  You will
be then put into the platform's configuration menu.  If the default
is acceptable, simply exit and save.  You target image will then
be installed (any packages that are needed will be downloaded and built)

Your target image will be placed in the sub-directory 'rootfs'.  This
should be NFS-exported and used as the root filesystem for your
chosen target.


---+ Changing the Target Image configuration

If you later decide to add or remove a package from your target image,
simply run:

<verbatim>
./ltib --configure
</verbatim>

This will re-prompt you for the platform/board config.  In the board
config screens, select packages as appropriate.  When you exit
the configuration screen, your target image will be adjusted accordinly.
